Scroll through the Pokemon directory, view each Pokemon description, and build your team. This project was made by fetching data from the Pokemon API. Users have the ability to scroll through a list of Pokemon.
Once the user clicks on a specific card, the Pokemon's image and their information will be displayed.
Users can build their personal Pokemon deck team by adding the Pokemon to their team inventory(team limit is set to 6).
Users can delete a Pokemon from their team as well as search for specific Pokemon.
